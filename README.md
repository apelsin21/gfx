# gfx
graphical effects in c++11 and opengl 3

# building
to build you need glew, assimp, sdl2, freeimage, freetype2, and a c++11 capable compiler.
which does include std::thread.

configure the cmake project as you want it, and build

on windows you need to specify locations for the dependencies(i may add default locations later on)
